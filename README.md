# pic-Search-Pixel-app

This project is a React-based photo gallery application that utilizes the Pexels API to display a collection of high-quality images. Users can search for specific categories of photos, such as "nature," and view the results in a responsive grid layout. Each image card showcases the photo, photographer details, and a download option. It includes navigation via React Router, allowing users to switch between a homepage and a save section seamlessly.
